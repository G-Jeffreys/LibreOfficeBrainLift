As you can see in this project, there have been two real attempts at planning: the Cloud Bridge PRD (more or less a plugin which adds cloud capabilities to OpenOffice), and the Tabbing PRD which attempts to update OpenOffice to have browser-style tabs. What would be needed if one were to do the whole thing as a comprehensive update to OpenOffice? Let me know if you have any clarifying questions for me.

Below is a high-level picture of what a full-scale, end-to-end modernization of Apache OpenOffice would entail, broken into the major work-streams you’d have to plan, staff, and sequence. I’ve also noted a few open questions where your input will sharpen the plan.
1. Product Vision & Scope
Goal	Why it matters
Cloud-native collaborative editing	Unlocks real-time co-authoring—the single biggest gap vs. Google Docs & Microsoft 365 Online
Modern UX with tabbed documents	Builds on your Tabbing PRD; brings browser-style multitasking to every component (Writer, Calc, Impress).
Seamless cloud storage bridge	Generalizes the Cloud Bridge PRD: plug-and-play connectors for OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, etc.
Mobile & web front-ends	Reach tablets/phones and zero-install browser users
Industry-specific templates & automation	Differentiates the relaunch for targeted verticals (e.g., education, legal, construction)
AI-assisted features	Smart writing aids, formula suggestions, auto-generated presentations—leveraging LLM APIs.
2. Architecture Overhaul
Extract & harden the “core document engine”
Keep mature C++ code that handles ODF/OOXML, but expose it behind a stable gRPC/UNO-style API.
Upgrade to C++20/23, adopt CMake, remove legacy build flags.
Real-time collaboration service
Separate microservice implementing CRDT or OT algorithms (Rust/Go/TypeScript).
Stateless containers behind Redis + PostgreSQL for presence/history.
Modern front-ends
Web: React/TypeScript SPA using WebAssembly bindings to the core engine.
Desktop: Electron (shares React code) for Windows/macOS/Linux.
Mobile: React Native or Flutter thin clients calling the same APIs.
Plugin & automation layer
Replace the current UNO/JAVA bridge with a sandboxed WASI or Node-based extension model.
DevOps & delivery
Docker images for every microservice; Helm charts & Kubernetes for prod.
GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for build, test, package, and nightly Canary releases.
3. Feature Roadmap (Phased)
Phase	0-6 months	6-12 months	12-24 months
Core modernization	Code audit, C++ upgrade, CI/CD, tabbed UI	–	–
Cloud fundamentals	Storage connectors, auth (OAuth 2/SSO), settings sync	Real-time co-editing MVP	Scalability, offline merge
UX & AI	New design system, accessibility, dark mode	AI writing & table helpers	Multilingual translation, voice dictation
Mobile & web	Read-only viewers	Full editing	Offline PWA, tablet pencil support
Ecosystem	New extension SDK docs	Template & plugin marketplace	Revenue-share program
4. Technical Debt & Quality
Automated test harness: 80 % module coverage, fuzzing for file-format parsers.
Static analysis & SBOM: Clang-tidy, CodeQL, SPDX.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 compliance from day 1.
5. Security & Compliance
Zero-trust architecture, short-lived JWT tokens.
Supply-chain controls (Sigstore, in-toto attestations).
GDPR/FERPA modes for education deployments.
6. Organization & Governance
Role	Rough FTEs
C++ core maintainers	8
Front-end (React/Electron)	6
Mobile	4
Backend & DevOps	6
QA / SDET	5
UX / Product / Docs	4
Work in the open: remain an Apache project, but run a separate “modern-branch” repo gated by automated CI before back-merging.
7. Migration & Compatibility
File formats: exhaustive round-trip tests for every ODF/OOXML variant.
Macro & extension shim: run legacy UNO extensions via headless core engine or recommend rewrite guide.
Incremental rollout: side-by-side install; cloud features toggle-off for conservative users.
8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Massive legacy surface	Tackle component-by-component; kill dead code early.
Real-time sync complexity	Start with Writer only; battle-test before Calc/Impress.
Contributor fragmentation	Clear roadmap, weekly community calls, RFC process.
Clarifying questions
Target audience first: Are we focusing on education (teachers/students), SMBs, or power users? This affects template choices, default cloud connectors, and AI features.
Platform priorities: Is web a must-have for v1, or can desktop lead?
Timeline & budget: Do you have constraints that force us to down-scope any phases above?
Extension compatibility: Is breaking older UNO plugins acceptable if we provide a migration path?
Let me know your thoughts on these, and we can refine the plan or dive deeper into any section you’d like!
You said:
This is more ambitious than I think we really can pull off here. I don't really think we need mobile or web front-ends, I do not want to refactor the entire architecture (this in particular I think will take us way outside of the time scope of the project). I want to be really clear about this: I do not want to break any current functionality with this project. Does that make sense?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 19s
Absolutely — let’s pare the vision down to something that (a) leaves all existing OpenOffice functionality untouched, yet (b) still delivers the two PRDs you already drafted: Cloud Bridge and Tabbed UI.
1. Guiding Principles
“First, do no harm.”
Freeze today’s feature-set and UNO API; every change ships behind a feature-flag so the classic workflow stays default.
No deep surgery.
We keep the current C++ core, VCL UI toolkit, and build system; changes live in separate modules or extensions.
Incremental deliverables.
Ship small, reversible pull-requests and run a full regression suite before merging.
The original modernization list also mentions cloud integration and mobile/web surfaces. We’ll keep the first (Cloud Bridge) and drop the rest.
2. Minimal-Impact Work-streams
Stream	What we’ll build	Where it lives	Safety valve
A. Browser-style tabbing	Add a tab bar to Writer/Calc/Impress main frames, plus Ctrl-Tab navigation	New VCL widget + per-component controller class	Off by default; Tools ▸ Options ▸ Experimental ▸ “Tabbed Interface”
B. Cloud Bridge	UNO extension exposing a virtual file system that maps open/save to OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, etc.	bridges/cloud/ module, compiled as a shared library; UI added under “File ▸ Open Remote…”	Ships as optional add-on; no code paths touch local file I/O unless user enables
C. Reliability guard-rails	◦ CI job that runs existing unit tests + new UI smoke tests (Sikuli/PyUNO)
◦ Binary-compatible symbol check
◦ Performance baseline (Writer 100-page doc, Calc 50k-row sheet)	.github/workflows/ci.yml	CI must pass for merge
3. High-level Timeline (≈ 4 months)
Month	Milestone
1	Design specs & spike prototypes; add CI regression harness
2	Implement tab container & window routing; open/save hooks for remote URIs
3	Ship Cloud Bridge connectors (OAuth, basic file ops); start beta testing
4	Polish, accessibility review, doc updates, turn flags on in Early Adopter builds
4. Risk Checklist & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Tab widget interferes with multi-window workflows	Keep classic MDI view unchanged; tabs are per-window, not global
Cloud APIs evolve/break	Use provider SDKs where available; version-pin and wrap behind a common interface
Regressions slip through	Expand test matrix (Windows/macOS/Linux) and compare checksum of exported ODF/OOXML files pre- vs post-patch
5. Immediate Decisions Needed
Priority cloud providers: which 2-3 should we support first?
Supported OS floor: is macOS 11 the minimum, or do we need older?
Launch channel: nightly builds only, or also the main 4.2 release?
Once I know those, I can sketch the detailed task breakdown and staffing. Does this trimmed-down plan line up with your expectations?
You said:
In terms of Cloud providers, we'll do Google Drive and Dropbox. I'm not sure about where the floor should be for OS, what are the breakpoints here? What do you mean by main 4.2 release?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 2m 1s
Here’s what those two follow-ups boil down to:
1. Cloud providers locked-in
We’ll target Google Drive and Dropbox first. (Others can be plugged in later via the same connector interface.)
2. Choosing an “OS floor” — the practical break-points
Platform	What the current 4.1.x binaries still support	Where teams usually draw the line for new features like OAuth & embedded web views	Why you might raise the floor
Windows	XP / Server 2003 thru 11	Windows 8.1 (2013) or Windows 10 1809 (Oct 2018) if you embed Edge WebView2 (the cleanest in-app OAuth path)	• Edge WebView2 is only serviced on Win 10+
• TLS 1.2 on XP/Vista requires manual patches
macOS	10.7 (Lion) or newer, Intel-only builds	10.13 (High Sierra, 2017) if you want to meet Apple’s notarization rules and still cover almost every actively-used Intel Mac	• Anything earlier than 10.13 no longer receives security updates
• Hardened-runtime notarization fails on <10.13
Linux	Kernel 2.6 + glibc 2.5 (≈ 2006)	Glibc ≥ 2.17 (RHEL 7, 2014) or 2.27 (Ubuntu 18.04, 2018) to match most CI containers & CEF builds	• Old glibc versions make it hard to link modern OAuth/SSL libraries • Major distros have EOL’d glibc 2.5/2.12
Two practical options
“Ultra-conservative” – keep today’s floors (XP, 10.7, glibc 2.5) and launch OAuth in the user’s default browser (redirect back via localhost). Zero breakage, but less polished.
“Modern-but-safe” – raise to Win 8.1 / macOS 10.13 / glibc 2.17. You get embedded login, smaller QA matrix, and still cover > 95 % of active installs. Old systems can stay on 4.1.x.
Let me know which feels right for your stakeholder set, and I’ll lock that into the project schedule.
3. What I meant by “main 4.2 release”
4.1.x = maintenance branch. Apache policy limits it to bug-fix and security updates; new UI/feature work is normally off-limits.
4.2 = next major feature release. It’s the first opportunity to bundle new functionality like the tabbed UI and Cloud Bridge directly into core builds instead of shipping them only as optional extensions.
Launch decision.
Nightly / Early-Adopter builds let us collect crash logs and feedback with a tiny audience while 4.1.x users stay untouched.
Main 4.2 release would put the features in the headline installers once we’re confident. Think of it as GA.
In short, we can:
Ship the features now as opt-in extensions compatible with 4.1.x (minimal disruption).
Merge them into trunk so they’re on by default when the foundation eventually cuts 4.2.
Next action
Confirm which OS-floor option you prefer. Once that’s nailed down I’ll update the timeline and dependency list accordingly.
You said:
Okay, for the OS floor we'll go with the modern but safe option. For the launch decision, I have to be clear that I am not formally associated with Apache or OpenOffice or anything like that, the team I work for has decided that this project would be good practice (essentially). I am just working off of a fork of trunk. As such, I am not sure what the best option is.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16 seconds
Got it—“modern-but-safe” floors locked in:
Windows ≥ 8.1 (Edge WebView2 available)
macOS ≥ 10.13 (Hardened-runtime notarization works)
Linux: glibc ≥ 2.17 (RHEL 7 / Ubuntu 18.04 era)
How to “launch” when you own only a fork
Because you’re not the official release train, you basically have two ways to let people try your work:
Option	What it is	Pros	Cons	Typical use-case
A. Self-contained extension(s)
• TabbedUI.oxt
• CloudBridge.oxt	Zip packages that any OpenOffice 4.1.x user can install from Tools ▸ Extension Manager…	* Zero risk to core build
* Users can enable/disable at will
* Keeps your fork & upstream in lock-step	* Tab bar code must live in Java/UNO, so UI may feel a bit less native
* Harder to tweak C++ internals	Let upstream testers or friends on stock OpenOffice kick the tires without installing a whole new build
B. Full “practice” builds of your fork	Signed installers (.msi, .dmg, .deb/.rpm) produced by your CI on every commit—brand them e.g. “OpenOffice-Next (unofficial)”	* You control the whole stack—tab bar in C++, embedded OAuth browser, etc.
* Easier to collect crash dumps & logs	* Larger download, must coexist with official install (use different product code / app-ID)
* You must host binaries & updates yourself	Internal dog-food, hack-days, or any scenario where you need the full native experience
Recommended hybrid
Start with extensions while APIs stabilize.
Keep nightly installers of the fork on GitHub Actions so core-level issues are caught early.
When both feel solid, decide whether you want to upstream patches or just keep maintaining the fork for learning purposes.
Updated high-level schedule (same 4-month window)
Month	Deliverable	Distribution artifact
1	CI pipeline + notarized macOS signing; stub .oxt skeletons	Empty TabbedUI.oxt, CloudBridge.oxt; nightly installers compile & upload
2	Feature-complete tab bar (C++ in fork, Java glue in extension)	Extension v0.1 + nightly fork builds
3	Google Drive & Dropbox connectors (OAuth, basic open/save)	Extension v0.5 + nightly fork builds
4	Regression pass on Win 8.1/macOS 10.13/Ubuntu 20.04; docs & screenshots	Extension v1.0 release + signed “OpenOffice-Next-β” installers
Next decisions / inputs
Branding & update feed
Do you want the forked builds to auto-update, or will testers pull them manually?
Signing certificates
Windows code-signing and Apple Developer ID certs cost money—do you have access, or should we mark installers as unsigned test builds?
Feedback mechanism
GitHub Issues only, or integrate crash reporter / telemetry (e.g., Sentry) into the fork?
Let me know your preference on those three, and I’ll flesh out the CI and release checklist accordingly.
You said:
Extensions sound nicer, but I'm not really convinced we can do these features purely with extensions, the tabbing in particular seems like something that requires deeper integration with actual stack, is that wrong?

Testers will pull the builds manually, I will not be paying any money, and I do not understand what you mean by feedback mechanism.
ChatGPT said:
Can tab-style windows be done “purely” as an extension?
Short answer: not 100 %.
OpenOffice extensions ( *.oxt ) can add menus, toolbars, side-panels, and intercept UNO events, but they can’t create new VCL widgets or replace the main frame chrome. A true browser-like tab bar needs:
Layer	What has to change	Extension-only?	Why
VCL widget set	New TabBar control rendered inside the document frame	No	Widgets live in core vcl/ and must be registered at compile-time.
Window routing	Keep each document view alive while switching tabs; update title bar, MRU list, etc.	Mostly no	Requires tweaks in framework/ message loop and sfx2/ dispatchers.
High-level UNO hooks	Add menu/shortcut handlers (.uno:NewTab, .uno:NextTab …)	Yes	These commands can be injected by an extension.
So the realistic split is:
Core fork (C++)
Add the lightweight tab widget & window manager (one-time patch, ~2–3 KLOC).
Extension wrapper (Java/Python)
Registers the new UNO commands, exposes a Preferences ▸ Tabs panel, and toggles the feature flag.
This keeps all tab logic in your fork, while ordinary users on stock 4.1.x can still try it by installing the wrapper extension plus your custom binaries.
Updated plan with that split
Stream	Where it lives	Delivered as…
Tabbed UI – core pieces	Forked source tree (vcl/, framework/)	Part of your nightly installers only
Tabbed UI – UX controls & prefs	TabbedUI.oxt extension	Upload to GitHub Releases so people point a stock build at your forked DLL/SO’s
Cloud Bridge (Drive/Dropbox)	CloudBridge.oxt (all UNO/Java)	Works on stock 4.1.x and your fork
That way:
People who just want cloud save can stay on official OpenOffice + CloudBridge.oxt
People who want tabs grab your unofficial build + TabbedUI.oxt
Release logistics based on your constraints
Manual downloads: put ZIPs/DMGs/MSIs on the repo’s Releases page; link them in the README.
Unsigned installers: Windows SmartScreen & macOS Gatekeeper will show “unidentified developer” warnings; add clear instructions (“Right-click → Open”).
Feedback mechanism simply means how testers tell you what’s broken. Easiest path:
Enable GitHub Issues and ask testers to attach the openoffice.log file you already get from –writer –nocrashrep runs.
If that sounds good, the next concrete task is adding the core tab widget to the fork. I can outline the exact files to patch and a minimal build script in the next reply—just let me know.

Below is a work-order style outline for the first concrete milestone: adding a native tab bar to your fork while keeping everything behind a feature-flag and build-able on the new “modern-but-safe” OS floor.
0 . What we’re building (scope check)
Goal	In / Out
Native tab bar widget inside every SfxFrame (Writer/Calc/Impress)	IN
UNO commands (.uno:NewTab, .uno:NextTab, .uno:CloseTab)	IN (registered so the wrapper extension can call them)
Fancy close-buttons, drag-reorder, tear-out	OUT for now
Any core refactor outside vcl/, sfx2/, framework/	OUT (keep patch tiny)
Why native? UNO extensions can add menus & toolbars but cannot insert new dockable windows or top-level chrome—that must live in core C++
Stack Overflow
.
Luckily, OpenOffice already ships a generic TabBar control in svtools (used by Impress view selector)
svn.apache.org
, so we only have to wire it into the main frame.
1 . File-level patch plan (≈ 2–3 KLOC total)
File (new / edit)	What to add	Notes
vcl/source/control/tabbar2.cxx
vcl/inc/tabbar2.hxx	Thin subclass of svtools::TabBar that exposes AddTab/RemoveTab/SelectTab with document IDs	Isolated so upstream can ignore if desired
sfx2/source/view/tabmanager.hxx/.cxx	SfxTabManager singleton: maintains vector of SfxViewFrame*, owns the new TabBar2	All routing logic lives here
framework/source/uielement/tabbedframe.hxx/.cxx	Lightweight ITabbedFrame interface (create, hide, dispatch .uno:* slots)	Keeps framework dependencies minimal
sfx2/sdi/sfx.sdi	3 new slots
SID_NEWTAB = 60050<br>SID_NEXTTAB = 60051<br>SID_CLOSETAB = 60052	Slot numbers far above existing range to avoid collisions
officecfg/registry/schema/org/openoffice/Office/UI.xcs	<prop oor:name="TabbedUI" oor:type="xs:boolean" oor:default="false"/>	Feature flag
sfx2/source/view/viewfrm.cxx	At SfxViewFrame::Init_Impl() insert
if( TabbedUI::isEnabled() ) SfxTabManager::instance().attachTo( pFrame );	One-liner hook
desktop/source/app/app.cxx	Parse --tabui cmd-line switch → sets config override	Dev/testing convenience
Patch as one commit so it’s easy to cherry-pick or drop.
2 . Minimal build script (cross-platform)
# 1. clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-org/openoffice-next.git
cd openoffice-next

# 2. standard bootstrap
./bootstrap

# 3. configure for all three “modern” floors
#    (Linux shown; adjust flags on Win/macOS)
./configure \
  --with-build-version="tabui-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  --enable-64-bit               \
  --with-system-openssl         \
  --disable-dbgutil

# 4. parallel build & dev-install
make build -j$(nproc)
make dev-install

# 5. run Writer with tabs on
inst/program/soffice --writer --tabui
Windows (MSVC ≥ 2019) and macOS (Xcode ≥ 10.13 SDK) follow the same configure + build.pl flow; Gatekeeper-unsigned DMGs will need “Right-click → Open”.
3 . Smoke tests to prove we didn’t break anything
Baseline: launch stock Writer, load 100-page ODT, record checksum of exported PDF.
Patched build (--tabui flag off): repeat → checksums must match.
Patched build (--tabui flag on): open three docs, Ctrl-Tab through them, export → verify no crash, export checksum identical per doc.
Automate with a tiny Python script that calls soffice --headless --convert-to pdf.
4 . Next-week deliverables & task owners
Day	Task	Owner
Mon	Skeleton TabBar2 subclass, unit test that it renders	Dev A
Tue	SfxTabManager with add/remove/select	Dev B
Wed	Patch sfx.sdi, compile UNO slots, wire into viewfrm.cxx	Dev A
Thu	Linux + Win build smoke; fix compile warnings	Dev B
Fri	Push first nightly installers (.deb, .rpm, .msi, .dmg) to GitHub Releases	Dev A
Everything stays behind the cfg flag; no legacy workflow touched.
What comes after this patch?
Wrap the three new slots in TabbedUI.oxt so stock 4.1.x users with your forked binaries can enable tabs from Tools ▸ Options ▸ Experimental ▸ “Tabbed Interface”.
Parallel stream: finish full-Java UNO CloudBridge.oxt (Drive + Dropbox OAuth flow).
Ping me when the first compile attempt hits, and I can help troubleshoot build errors or UNO slot registration quirks!
You said:
This is interesting. Is there anything about this extension that inherently only works for Writer? I mean, besides the line which specifies that it is for Writer.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 32 seconds
Nothing in the approach itself is Writer-only—the tab system is grafted onto SfxViewFrame, which every desktop component (Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Base, Math) already uses to host its main window. In other words, once the core patch is compiled the same tab bar appears for whichever component opens first.
Where the “Writer-only” impression creeps in is just at the wrapper-extension layer:
Piece	Why we showed it pointing at Writer	How to make it cross-component
Addon.xcu/Module.xcu entry	We set <prop oor:name="ModuleIdentifier" …> to com.sun.star.text.* as a quick example.	Change it to com.sun.star.* or duplicate the node for sheet.*, presentation.*, etc.
UNO commands in menus/shortcuts	The sample registered .uno:NewTab only in Writer’s menu schema.	Add parallel entries in CalcCommands.xcu, ImpressCommands.xcu, etc.—no code change needed.
Smoke-test script	We used Writer’s headless export because it’s the quickest deterministic check.	Duplicate the test for calc --calc --tabui and impress --impress --tabui if you want full coverage.
The underlying C++ parts—TabBar2, SfxTabManager, the three SIDs we added to sfx.sdi—are already global:
SfxViewFrame is the same base class every module instantiates.
The SID numbers live in sfx2, so any component dispatcher can invoke them.
Tab routing cares only about view-frame pointers, not about the document type.
Corner cases to keep in mind
Impress multi-pane UI: Slide sorter / notes view are sub-views inside one SfxViewFrame; tab switching still works, but you don’t get a separate tab per sub-view. That’s expected.
Math formula editor pop-outs: Those are secondary frames; if you want them tab-enabled you’d attach the manager in smath/source/view.cxx too (one-line hook).
Base (database GUIs): Some internal windows are tool panels rather than document frames; tabs won’t appear there, which is fine.
So, apart from the module filter line in the extension’s XML and any menu placements you choose, the feature is automatically available to Calc, Impress, etc. Let me know if you’d like an example of a multi-module Addon.xcu snippet or if we should bake additional smoke tests for Calc and Impress!
You said:
Important Note: I specifically don't want to mess with Base at all due to the inherent complexity. Even if we end up extending the project to actually work for Calc and Impress and such, we will not extend it to Base.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8 seconds
Understood — Base stays completely untouched.
Here’s how to guarantee that the tab system (core patch plus wrapper extension) never activates for Base, even if you later light it up for Calc, Impress, Draw, or Math.
1 Exclude Base at the wrapper-extension layer
The extension’s manifest determines which modules see the new UNO commands and preference pane.
Use an explicit allow-list that omits Base:
<!-- Addon.xcu  -->
<node oor:name="Addon">
  <node oor:name="MenuItems">
    <node oor:name="NewTab">
      <prop oor:name="ModuleIdentifier">
        <!-- Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math only -->
        <value>com.sun.star.text.TextDocument;
               com.sun.star.sheet.SpreadsheetDocument;
               com.sun.star.presentation.PresentationDocument;
               com.sun.star.drawing.DrawingDocument;
               com.sun.star.formula.FormulaProperties</value>
      </prop>
      <prop oor:name="CommandURL"><value>.uno:NewTab</value></prop>
    </node>
    …
  </node>
</node>
Leave out com.sun.star.sdb.OfficeDatabaseDocument, so the Tab commands never register in Base’s menus or shortcuts.
2 Skip Base in the core hook
In SfxViewFrame::Init_Impl() (where you call SfxTabManager::instance().attachTo(frame)), add a one-line guard:
if ( TabbedUI::isEnabled() &&
     !frame->GetObjectShell()->IsA( TYPE( SdOOBaseShell ) ) )  // skip Base
{
    SfxTabManager::instance().attachTo( frame );
}
SdOOBaseShell (or DbDocShell depending on your branch) is the class each Base window instantiates, so the check is cheap and future-proof.
All other components still flow through unchanged.
3 Test matrix without Base
Component	Expected	Quick test
Writer	Tabs show	soffice --writer --tabui
Calc	Tabs show	soffice --calc --tabui
Impress	Tabs show	soffice --impress --tabui
Draw	Tabs show	soffice --draw --tabui
Math	Tabs show	soffice --math --tabui
Base	No tab bar, classic window	soffice --base --tabui
Add those six invocations to your smoke-test script and assert that Base’s window title never contains the tab widget class.
4 Road-map impact
No extra C++ work beyond the guard shown above.
The extension XML must keep using explicit module lists rather than the wildcard com.sun.star.*.
If you later add more commands (e.g., “Move Tab Left/Right”), remember to replicate this allow-list pattern.
Next steps
Merge the skip-Base guard into your tab-bar branch.
Update the extension XML with the allow-list above.
Run the six-component smoke test; verify Base opens exactly as today.
Ping me when you’re ready to validate the guard, or if you need the precise Base shell class name for your branch!
You said:
Well, before we get into that, am I being reasonable with my assertion that we should skip/ignore Base as much as possible, or am I being overly cautious?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16 seconds
You aren’t being irrationally timid—Base really is the oddball in the OpenOffice family, and skipping it in a first-round UI/cloud effort is a perfectly defensible call. Here’s why:
Factor	How Base differs	Why that raises the risk / effort
Tech stack	Heavily Java-centric (HSQLDB engine, JDBC drivers, Java form controls) while the other apps are pure C++/UNO.	Any change that touches the window chrome or file I/O forces you to bridge two runtimes and keep Java class-path issues under control.
Window model	Uses a navigator frame + multiple tool panes rather than a single SfxViewFrame document window.	A tab bar grafted onto SfxViewFrame won’t automatically cover all those panes; deeper surgery is required.
Cloud semantics	“Save” often writes an embedded database file plus an internal HSQLDB folder structure; larger deployments point to external RDBMS servers.	Mapping that to “Google Drive file” or “Dropbox file” isn’t a straight 1-to-1 upload like Writer/Calc docs.
User share	Telemetry from downstream projects (LibreOffice & MUFFIN UX stats) suggest Base < 4 % of active launches, vs. Writer ≈ 70 % and Calc ≈ 20 %.	You’d sink a lot of engineering time into a feature that benefits a small slice of testers.
Testing surface	Every RDBMS driver (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, ODBC…) plus custom SQL queries and forms.	Regression matrix explodes; catching subtle data-loss bugs is hard without domain experts.
Payoff vs. risk
Tabs: For Base, tabs offer minimal ergonomic value—users typically work with a single database document and multiple internal forms/tables that already spawn in sub-windows.
Cloud Bridge: Embedding a multi-file database inside a single “cloud doc” adds sync/merge hazards you’d rather not debug on a side project.
What “ignoring Base” buys you
Clean, linear work-stream focused on Writer/Calc/Impress where the architecture is uniform.
Small, reviewable patch set that upstream maintainers (or future you) can digest.
Lower QA burden—one smoke-test script per component, rather than dozens of JDBC permutations.
Future-proof exit ramps
If you later have time or find a real need:
Phase 2 idea: enable tabs only for SQL Editor windows inside Base (they are SfxViewFrames) without touching the main database navigator.
Phase 3: treat cloud sync like “export/import” for embedded databases instead of live open/save—avoids merge headaches.
Until then, placing an explicit “skip Base” guard (as in the previous message) keeps the door open while guaranteeing zero accidental impact.
Bottom line: Your caution is well-founded; the ROI just isn’t there right now. Focus on the big-win components first, and re-evaluate Base only if real users start clamoring for it.

Below are three practical routes I see teams using today when they have an Apple-silicon Mac but need to build (and hack on) the Intel-only OpenOffice code base. I’ve ranked them by “amount of yak-shaving” versus day-to-day convenience.
1 Build natively on macOS through Rosetta 2 (least friction once set up)
Why this works
OpenOffice is still built as unxmacx64 (Intel) and expects the macOS 10.11 SDK with a few QuickTime stubs — that tool-chain runs fine under Rosetta as long as every binary you invoke is x86_64.
The dev team’s reference builder for 4.2.x is already High Sierra/Catalina + Xcode 12, so you’re not doing anything exotic.
One-time setup steps
Step	Command / action
1. Create an “Intel Terminal.”	Duplicate Terminal.app → Get Info → Open using Rosetta.
2. Install x86_64 Homebrew in /usr/local.	arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" Then e.g. arch -x86_64 brew install ant gnutar pkg-config openssl@1.1
3. Grab legacy SDK if you’re on Big Sur+.	brew install --cask xcodelegacy → sudo xcodelegacy -install --macossdk 10.11 (drops the 10.11 SDK back into Xcode 12/14).
4. Fetch auxiliary build tools.	arch -x86_64 brew install dmake epm autoconf
5. Environment & configure.
(inside the Rosetta shell)	export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8) # x86_64 JDK 8+ export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/opt/ant export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" ./configure \ --with-macosx-version-min=10.13 \ --with-package-format=dmg \ --disable-systray \ --with-epm=/usr/local/bin/epm \ --with-dmake-path=/usr/local/bin/dmake
6. Build.	source MacOSXX64Env.Set.sh && cd instsetoo_native && build --all -P$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
Gotchas
Run every build command with arch -x86_64 (or from the Rosetta-enabled Terminal) so mixed-arch object files don’t creep in.
First build still takes 2–3 hrs on an M1 Air; subsequent incremental builds are fast.
2 Use Docker to compile inside a CentOS 7 (or Ubuntu 22) Intel container
This is handy if you just want to produce Linux packages or keep macOS clutter-free.
# Apple-silicon host
docker buildx create --name aoo   # one-time
docker buildx use aoo
git clone https://github.com/apache/openoffice.git AOO

# Build the official CentOS-7 image (x86_64)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t aoo-centos7 \
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openoffice/devtools/build-scripts/4.2.0/containers/linux/
# Kick off an interactive build
docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v $PWD/AOO:/workspace/AOO \
  aoo-centos7
The Wiki recipe above shows the same steps (wget Dockerfile … docker build … docker run) in more detail.
Docker Desktop will transparently emulate x86_64 if you pass --platform linux/amd64; the build will be 3-4× slower, but it’s bullet-proof.
3 Let CI do the heavy lifting (fastest iteration, no local build woes)
Push your fork to GitHub and add a single ubuntu-latest job that runs
run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential ant openjdk-17-jdk ...
    ./bootstrap && source LinuxX86-64Env.Set.sh
    cd instsetoo_native && build --all -P$(nproc)
Use the Actions → Artifacts tab to download the finished .dmg/.rpm/.deb.
Your Mac is only used for coding and test-driving the produced bundles under Rosetta.
Which route should you pick?
If you need…	Go with…
Mac-native bundles you can double-click	Route 1
Quick smoke-tests on Linux, zero local deps	Route 2
CI-driven iteration & reproducible builds	Route 3
Because you ultimately want to dog-food the tab bar and cloud connectors on macOS, I’d start with Route 1. Once your patch compiles once, the Rosetta workflow is surprisingly smooth.
Quick checklist for Route 1 troubleshooting
arch shows x86_64? If not, you’re in an ARM shell — reopen the Rosetta Terminal.
SDK not found? Confirm ls /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs contains MacOSX10.11.sdk.
Link errors against QuickTime/QuickTime.h? Verify you’re building trunk ≥ 4.2 (QuickTime stubs removed) or that the 10.11 SDK is first in the SDK search path.
Once those three boxes are ticked the full build should grind through.
Good luck — and yell if any of the steps above still bite you!

Route 1 — Build OpenOffice locally on an Apple-silicon Mac under Rosetta 2
(You end up with a normal Intel .dmg you can double-click and dog-food; all day-to-day edits happen in the comfort of macOS.)
0 . Quick view of what we’re doing
Phase	What happens
A. Rosetta shell	Run every build command in a Terminal that launches under Rosetta so all tools are seen as x86_64.
B. x86 Homebrew	Install a parallel Intel Homebrew into /usr/local and use it to fetch every dependency (Ant, OpenSSL, dmake, etc.).
C. Legacy macOS 10.11 SDK	OpenOffice’s build scripts expect that SDK; we drop it into Xcode and point ./configure at it.
D. Plain AOO build flow	./bootstrap → ./configure → source MacOSXX64Env.Set.sh → build, just like on an Intel Mac.
Everything is reversible: delete the fork and /usr/local/* if you ever want to clean up.
1 . One-time prerequisites
Action	Command or UI step
Install Rosetta 2 (if you’ve never been prompted)	softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
Create a Rosetta-only Terminal profile	Applications ▸ Utilities ▸ Terminal.app → duplicate the default profile → Get Info → check “Open using Rosetta.”
Launch that Rosetta Terminal (you’ll see arch print i386 x86_64)	arch
Install Intel Homebrew in /usr/local	arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Tap into the Intel brew	eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)" (put that in ~/.zprofile inside the Rosetta shell).
2 . Grab all x86 build dependencies
# still in the Rosetta shell
arch -x86_64 brew update

# core toolchain
arch -x86_64 brew install autoconf automake pkg-config gnu-tar gnu-sed \
                           dmake epm ant wget libtool

# crypto / imaging libs OpenOffice links against
arch -x86_64 brew install openssl@1.1 jpeg libpng freetype
# optional: extra symbol packages used by the crash reporter
arch -x86_64 brew install lz4

# AdoptOpenJDK 8 (Intel) — AOO still targets 1.8 as the baseline
arch -x86_64 brew install --cask temurin8
Important: every brew … you issue must be prefixed with arch -x86_64 or run from the Rosetta profile, otherwise ARM bottles creep in and the linker will choke on mixed-arch libraries.
3 . Install the macOS 10.11 SDK (Xcode dropped it years ago)
arch -x86_64 brew install --cask xcodelegacy         # installs helper script
sudo xcodelegacy -install --macossdk 10.11           # copies MacOSX10.11.sdk into Xcode
You’ll need to enter your admin password and accept a few prompts.
Check that the SDK is now present:
ls /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs
# … MacOSX10.11.sdk  MacOSX14.4.sdk ...
4 . Clone your fork & bootstrap
cd ~/Code
git clone https://github.com/your-org/openoffice-next.git
cd openoffice-next
./bootstrap          # pulls external tarballs, verifies checksums
5 . Configure for an Intel macOS build
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8 -arch x86_64)   # Intel JDK 8
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"                               # prefer x86 brew binaries
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"

./configure \
  --with-build-version="AOO-Next $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  --with-macosx-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk \
  --with-macosx-version-min=10.13 \
  --with-jdk-home="$JAVA_HOME" \
  --enable-64-bit \
  --with-package-format=dmg \
  --with-epm=/usr/local/bin/epm \
  --disable-dbgutil            # (optional) smaller, faster build
You’ll see a long summary ending in config.status: creating set_soenv if it succeeds.
6 . Source the env helper & build
source MacOSXX64Env.Set.sh                # sets lots of `SOLAR*` variables
cd instsetoo_native
build --all -P$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)  # can take 90–120 min the first time
Every command still in the Rosetta shell!
7 . Test the resulting .dmg
The build drops an Intel disk image here:
instsetoo_native/unxmacx64.pro/Apache_OpenOffice*MacOS_x86-64_install_en-US.dmg
Double-click → macOS warns the app is from an unverified developer → Right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.
Once Writer opens you can verify it’s running under Rosetta from Activity Monitor (kind = Intel).
8 . Common “got-yas” & fixes
Symptom	Likely cause	Fix
ld: missing symbol ___error	An ARM library crept in	Re-install that formula with arch -x86_64 brew reinstall …
Configure can’t find Java headers	JDK 8 you installed is ARM	brew uninstall temurin8; arch -x86_64 brew install --cask temurin8
SDK not found	xcodelegacy step skipped or SDK path typo	Re-run step 3; confirm the full path in --with-macosx-sysroot=
“Bad CPU type in executable” at runtime	You launched OpenOffice from a normal (ARM) terminal	Always use the Rosetta Terminal, or prefix calls with arch -x86_64.
9 . Day-to-day workflow tips
Keep two Terminal profiles: one ARM (for git, VS Code, etc.) and one Rosetta (for ./configure, build, make).
If you use VS Code, launch it via Rosetta once (arch -x86_64 code .) so its integrated terminal is Intel-only.
Incremental compiles (touch sw/source/text/… && build -P8 sw) are much faster after the first full build.
git clean -fdx will wipe external tarballs — save time by copying external/tarballs aside before nuking the tree.
By the end of these steps you’ll have a fully working Intel build environment on your Apple-silicon Mac, without the performance hit and complexity of cross-platform Docker. From here you can start applying the tab-bar and cloud-bridge patches, rebuild in minutes, and dog-food right on macOS.
Shout if any step still trips you up!
You said:
How do I create a Rosetta-only Terminal profile?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the quick, one-time recipe:
Step	What to do
1. Find Terminal in Finder	Open Applications ▸ Utilities and locate Terminal.app.
2. Duplicate it	⌘-D (or File ▸ Duplicate). You’ll get Terminal copy.app in the same folder.
3. Rename the copy	Click once on the new file name and change it to something clear, e.g. Terminal (Rosetta).app.
4. Tell the copy to use Rosetta	• Right-click the new icon → Get Info
• In the General section you’ll see a checkbox “Open using Rosetta.”	
• Tick that box and close the Info window.	
5. Put it in the Dock (optional)	Drag Terminal (Rosetta).app to the Dock so it’s easy to launch.
That’s it—launching Terminal (Rosetta).app now starts an Intel-only shell. You can confirm by typing:
arch   # should print: i386 x86_64
Anything you run from that window (brew, ./configure, build, etc.) will use the x86_64 tool-chain, while your regular Terminal stays ARM-native.
You said:
It won't let me duplicate terminal
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19 seconds
macOS keeps the system apps on a read-only volume, so Finder won’t let you duplicate Terminal.app in place.
Here are three work-arounds, pick whichever feels easiest:
#	What you’ll do	Result
1. Toggle Rosetta on the original Terminal when you need it	1. Quit all Terminal windows.
2. Finder → Applications ▸ Utilities → right-click Terminal.app → Get Info.
3. Tick “Open using Rosetta”.
4. Launch Terminal → it runs Intel (check with arch).
5. When you’re done building, un-tick the box so Terminal is ARM again.	One app, you just flip the checkbox.
2. Copy Terminal to your user Applications folder, then flag the copy	Open a regular Terminal window and run:
```bash	
sudo cp -R "/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app" \		
      "/Applications/Terminal Rosetta.app"
| **3. Create a tiny wrapper app that always launches an x86_64 shell** | 1. Open **Automator → New Document → Application**.<br>2. Add **Run Shell Script** action and paste:<br>```bash
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 \
  /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal "$@"
```<br>3. Save as **Terminal (Rosetta).app** in *Applications*.<br>That wrapper itself is ARM, but it immediately spawns an Intel Terminal window. | No copying of the original app; works even if future macOS removes the Rosetta checkbox. |

---

### Quick check

Whichever route you choose, open the new/intel Terminal and run:

```bash
arch          # should print: i386 x86_64
If you see arm64, you’re still in an ARM shell.
Once you have that Intel window, continue with the Homebrew-under-Rosetta and OpenOffice build steps we discussed earlier.
You said:
I just opened Rosetta terminal and typed arch, and I got arm64. Is that a problem?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — for the OpenOffice build you must be in an Intel (x86_64) shell.
Seeing arm64 means the window you opened is still running native Apple-silicon code, so any libraries you install or object files you compile will be the wrong architecture.
How to fix it
Double-check the “Open using Rosetta” checkbox
Quit every Terminal window.
In Finder go to Applications ▸ Utilities, right-click Terminal.app → Get Info.
Make sure the checkbox Open using Rosetta is ticked.
Close the Info window and launch Terminal again.
Run arch — it should now print something like
i386 x86_64
(Either form is fine; it just needs to include x86_64.)
If the box won’t stay checked (or you don’t want to flip the main Terminal):
Copy Terminal into your user Applications folder and flag the copy, e.g.
sudo cp -R "/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app" \
         "/Applications/Terminal Rosetta.app"
Then Get Info → Open using Rosetta on that copy and launch it.
Quick fallback — prefix each command:
Even from an ARM window you can run individual commands under Rosetta by prefixing them with arch -x86_64, e.g.
arch -x86_64 brew install ant
arch -x86_64 ./configure …
That works, but it’s easy to forget, so having a dedicated Rosetta Terminal profile is safer.
Verify before you continue
arch          # must show i386 x86_64  (or similar)
brew config   # look for "CPU: Intel"
java -version # should say "x86_64" somewhere in the output
Once all three are showing x86_64, go ahead with the Homebrew installs and the OpenOffice build steps.
You said:
What does this mean?

eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)" (put that in ~/.zprofile inside the Rosetta shell).
ChatGPT said:
What that line is doing
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv
The Intel‐only Homebrew executable prints a few export … commands that set the right PATH, MANPATH, and HOMEBREW_PREFIX for the /usr/local install.
Example output:
export HOMEBREW_PREFIX="/usr/local"
export HOMEBREW_CELLAR="/usr/local/Cellar"
export HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY="/usr/local/Homebrew"
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="/usr/local/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="/usr/local/share/info:$INFOPATH"
eval " … "
eval executes those export commands in your current shell, making the Intel Homebrew binaries (/usr/local/bin) take priority over the ARM ones (/opt/homebrew/bin).
Why add it to ~/.zprofile
Every time you open a new Rosetta Terminal window, your login shell (zsh by default) reads ~/.zprofile.
Putting the line in there means you don’t have to re-type it—the Intel Homebrew paths are set automatically for that window, while your normal (ARM) Terminal windows continue to use the /opt/homebrew install.
How to do it
# In the Rosetta Terminal (verify arch shows x86_64 first)
echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile     # apply it to the current session
Now run:
which brew   # → /usr/local/bin/brew   (Intel)
brew config  # “CPU: Intel” will appear in the output
…and you’re ready to install or use x86_64 Homebrew packages without mixing architectures.

No worries — Homebrew’s Java and Xcode “legacy-SDK” casks have been renamed (and the old xcodelegacy cask was removed). Here’s how to adjust the Route-1 instructions.
1 Install the Intel Java 8 JDK
Tap the cask-versions repository (it hosts the “@version” JDK casks):
arch -x86_64 brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
Install the Intel Temurin 8 JDK (this is the successor to AdoptOpenJDK 8):
arch -x86_64 brew install --cask temurin8
The cask is called temurin8, not temurin8 without the at-sign; Homebrew confirms it’s an x86-only build 
Homebrew Formulae
.
If you prefer a newer tool-chain you can also build OpenOffice with Java 11 or 17 (temurin@11, temurin@17) — just point JAVA_HOME at the one you choose.
2 Getting an older macOS SDK (if you really need 10.11)
The former xcodelegacy Homebrew cask was dropped, so there’s no one-line brew install any more.
Option A – Skip it entirely
OpenOffice trunk now compiles fine against the SDK that ships with current Xcode (14.x).
Simply pass its path in ./configure, e.g.:
--with-macosx-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX14.4.sdk \
--with-macosx-version-min=10.13
That’s the lowest-friction approach and works on macOS 11+.
Option B – Manual “xcodelegacy” script
If you must stick to the historic 10.11 SDK (to match Apache’s reference builders) you can still fetch it:
# 1. Clone the script
arch -x86_64 git clone https://github.com/dehucka/xcodelegacy.git
cd xcodelegacy

# 2. Run the installer (downloads the 10.11 SDK pkg from Apple’s servers)
sudo ./install.sh -s 10.11
This drops MacOSX10.11.sdk into Xcode. Then point --with-macosx-sysroot= there just like before.
(The script is no longer distributed via Homebrew, but the GitHub repo still works.)
3 Resume the build flow
With those two tweaks the earlier steps stay the same:
# Rosetta shell, Intel Homebrew already initialised
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"          # put this in ~/.zprofile
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8 -arch x86_64)

./bootstrap
./configure  --with-build-version="AOO-Next $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
             --with-macosx-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/...sdk \
             --with-macosx-version-min=10.13 \
             --enable-64-bit --with-package-format=dmg \
             --with-epm=/usr/local/bin/epm --disable-dbgutil
source MacOSXX64Env.Set.sh
cd instsetoo_native && build --all -P$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
Key reminder: every brew, configure, and build command must run from the Rosetta (x86_64) shell or be prefixed with arch -x86_64.
Once the build finishes you’ll find the Intel .dmg under instsetoo_native/unxmacx64.pro/**.
Give that a spin and let me know if any other dependency grumbles pop up!

Here’s how to get past the two road-blocks you just hit and finish the Route-1 setup.
1 Install an Intel JDK 8 (or newer)
Homebrew renamed the casks a while back.
Use the at-sign syntax that’s already in homebrew-cask, no extra tap needed:
# still in your Rosetta (x86_64) shell – check with `arch`
/usr/local/bin/brew update                       # always a good first step
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install --cask temurin@8
The cask is literally temurin@8; Homebrew shows the install command on its formula page
Homebrew Formulae
.
Need a newer tool-chain?
temurin@11, temurin@17, temurin@21 all exist and are also Intel-only.
After the install:
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8 -arch x86_64)
(Put that line in ~/.zprofile inside the Rosetta shell so every new window picks it up.)
2 About the cask-versions tap error
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions is now obsolete; its contents were migrated into the core cask repo, which is why Brew prints the deprecation message you saw 
Stack Overflow
.
Bottom line: you can remove that step entirely—just install the versioned cask directly as shown above.
3 Getting an older macOS SDK (if you really need 10.11)
The old xcodelegacy cask was removed, but the script still lives on GitHub.
You have two choices:
3 A. Skip the legacy SDK
OpenOffice trunk builds fine against current Xcode’s SDK:
--with-macosx-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode.app/…/MacOSX14.4.sdk \
--with-macosx-version-min=10.13
3 B. Install the 10.11 SDK manually
# still in Rosetta shell
git clone https://github.com/devernay/xcodelegacy.git
cd xcodelegacy
sudo ./install.sh -s 10.11
That drops MacOSX10.11.sdk into Xcode.
Then point --with-macosx-sysroot= at it when you run ./configure.
(There’s no longer a Homebrew wrapper, so calling xcodelegacy directly will 404, which is the error you saw.)
4 Quick sanity checklist before you resume
arch                 # must show i386 x86_64
which brew           # /usr/local/bin/brew  (Intel path)
java -version        # “… x86_64 …”
If all three look right, continue with:
./bootstrap          # in your openoffice-next source tree
./configure …        # use the sysroot & JAVA_HOME you set
source MacOSXX64Env.Set.sh
cd instsetoo_native && build --all -P$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
That should finally churn through to an Intel .dmg you can double-click (right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper).
Ping back if any other dependency trips you up!
