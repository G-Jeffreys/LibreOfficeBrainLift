What would it take for me to few-shot train a local LLM to convert plaintext descriptions of math equations to OpenOffice Math equations, and vice-versa?
By "what would it take", what I mean is how much time, how many resources, etc. would it take to be able to do that task with what level of accuracy/reliability?

To few-shot train a local LLM to convert between plaintext math equation descriptions and OpenOffice Math equations, you'd need to consider these dimensions:
🔧 1. Task Scope
You're asking for bidirectional conversion:
Natural Language → OpenOffice Math (symbolic format)
OpenOffice Math → Natural Language description
This is a sequence-to-sequence translation problem with structured output.
🧠 2. Model Selection
To do this locally, you’ll likely want:
Small-to-medium LLM (3B–7B parameters) like:
Mistral 7B (open-weight)
LLaMA 3 8B (meta; local with enough RAM)
Phi-2 / TinyLlama (for extreme efficiency)
For higher quality (but more compute-heavy):
Mixtral (12.9B active params, local with 48–64GB RAM)
These models support instruction-tuned behavior and few-shot in-context learning (important for formatting tasks).
🧪 3. Few-Shot Training vs In-Context Learning
In-context learning (0-shot or few-shot prompting):
Pros: No training required
Cons: Limited capacity to generalize outside prompt examples
Fine-tuning (supervised):
Required for higher accuracy or domain specificity
You’d do this if the base model can’t reliably translate with examples
⏱️ 4. Time & Resources Estimate
👨‍💻 In-Context Prompting Only
Setup time: 2–3 hours
Resources: Any consumer GPU with 8–12GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060+)
Accuracy: ~70–80% if well-prompted, depending on math complexity
🧑‍🔬 Light Supervised Fine-Tuning (Few-shot training)
Step	Time	Resources
Data collection (300–1,000 examples)	2–5 hours (manual or script)	Human input
Data formatting (instruction → output pairs)	1 hour	Python scripts
Fine-tuning on GPU (LoRA/QLoRA)	1–3 hours	24–48GB VRAM recommended
Testing & validation	1–2 hours	Same GPU or CPU
Tools: Axolotl, Hugging Face Transformers, or LM Studio + LoRA
Hardware: RTX 3090 or better, or Colab Pro+
Accuracy:
100–500 training pairs → 85–90%+ accuracy on seen styles
Generalizes well if examples cover enough linguistic variance
📚 Data Needs
🔁 For conversion tasks, structure like:
Prompt: “Convert to OpenOffice Math: the square root of x plus y squared”
Completion: sqrt{x} + y^2
You’ll want:
100–500 well-formatted examples
A consistent input/output template
Validation on unseen phrasing (to test generalization)
🛠 Source Options:
Manually annotated dataset
Math stack exchange, OCR-ed math worksheets, or synthetic generation (e.g., SymPy or GPT-generated math)
🧪 Evaluation Criteria
BLEU or ROUGE for text similarity
Exact match on symbolic expressions
Human QA to spot semantic mismatches (e.g., wrong operator order)
✅ Recommendations
Goal	Approach	Effort	Accuracy
Prototype quickly	Few-shot prompting with Mistral	Low	~75–80%
Robust results	Fine-tune with 300–500 examples on 7B LLM	Medium	85–90%+
Production-grade	Fine-tune + RLHF or large dataset	High	95%+ with QA
