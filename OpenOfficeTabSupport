I suppose I should ask before I get too far: to what degree does OpenOffice currently have browser-style tabs? Natively, or via plugins, or whatever.

Apache OpenOffice does not currently have native browser-style tabs (like in modern browsers or tabbed terminal applications). Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its status and options:
‚úÖ Native Tab Support
Not available.
OpenOffice opens each document in a separate window rather than as tabs within one window.
Users often request tabbed UI support, but the feature has not been added to the core product.
üîå Extensions or Plugins
There is no official extension or plugin that provides browser-style tabs directly within OpenOffice.
Some third-party workarounds or macro-based tricks exist but they are fragile, not user-friendly, and not actively maintained.
üîÅ Alternative Approaches
LibreOffice, a fork of OpenOffice, does support a tabbed interface via its "Notebookbar" feature (since version 6), especially in "Tabbed" mode ‚Äî though it's not enabled by default.
For users who need a modern tabbed document editing experience, LibreOffice is significantly ahead in this regard.
üîß Modernization Opportunity
If you're pursuing a modernization project (e.g., targeting OpenOffice in the context of the Enterprise Week project), adding a native tabbed interface would be:
A highly visible and valuable usability enhancement.
A meaningful engineering challenge, requiring UI framework updates.
A great candidate for one of the six new features to implement.
Let me know if you want to explore implementing tabs in a modernized fork of OpenOffice (or whether LibreOffice might be a better starting point for this feature).
