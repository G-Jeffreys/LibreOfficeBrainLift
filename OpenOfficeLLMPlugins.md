Are there any open source LLM plugins for OpenOffice?
ChatGPT said:
As of now, there are no widely-used or officially maintained open-source LLM plugins specifically for Apache OpenOffice. Most AI-assisted writing or language model integrations are being developed for platforms with more active ecosystems, such as:
Microsoft Office (via Copilot or third-party add-ins)
LibreOffice (some early community explorations exist, often via Python macros or extensions)
Google Docs (through third-party integrations or Apps Script)
However, given that Apache OpenOffice shares a similar architecture to LibreOffice (both use UNO ‚Äî Universal Network Objects), it is technically feasible to create a plugin or macro that connects to an LLM API like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT or an open-source model (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral via LM Studio or Ollama) using:
Python + UNO bridge to access the OpenOffice document model
HTTP requests to interact with a local or remote LLM server
Suggestions if you're exploring this as a project:
Target LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice due to its larger and more active community.
Focus on a specific user pain point (e.g., auto-summarization, grammar correction, or document generation).
Use a local LLM instance (like LLaMA 3, Mistral, or OpenChat) via llama.cpp or Ollama for privacy and control.
Would you like a sample architecture or prototype concept for integrating an LLM into OpenOffice or LibreOffice?

The idea that is being pushed by my boss is Cursor for OpenOffice. Namely, a plugin for OpenOffice which has a Cursor-like chat interface which communicates with a model which can (through some kind of tools) manipulate OpenOffice documents for you, perhaps generating Math equations, writing letters in Writer, and so on. I have to ask, is this even plausible?
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî the idea of building a "Cursor-like" chat plugin for OpenOffice that uses an LLM to manipulate documents is plausible, though challenging. Here's a breakdown of what would be involved and the technical feasibility:
‚úÖ What Makes It Plausible
OpenOffice supports scripting and extension APIs:
Uses UNO (Universal Network Objects) to allow scripting in Python, Java, Basic, and C++.
You can access and manipulate Writer, Calc, Math, etc., programmatically.
Extensions can include custom UI elements like toolbars, dialogs, or docked panels ‚Äî meaning a chat UI is possible to embed.
LLMs can already act as assistants in text-based workflows:
Tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot for IDEs show how an LLM can interpret natural language and translate it into code edits or commands.
A similar pattern can be applied: user types a request, LLM interprets and generates actions, those are executed in OpenOffice.
Document automation with LLMs is mature:
Generating letters, filling in forms, summarizing, rewriting text, or inserting formatted equations are well within GPT-4, Claude, or even open models' capabilities.
There are precedents:
The LibreOffice community has experimented with AI-assisted writing via Python macros.
Microsoft 365 Copilot and Google Docs AI integrations set a clear precedent for what users expect.
‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Hurdles You Must Overcome
Area	Challenge
UI Integration	OpenOffice UI is dated and harder to customize compared to modern apps. Creating a docked "chat panel" in the side or bottom will require non-trivial use of UNO API + custom extension UI elements.
LLM Integration	You'll need to run or connect to an LLM (OpenAI API, local Ollama, etc.). Must handle prompt formatting, latency, cost (if not local), and streaming output if needed.
Tool Use / Actions	The hardest part: building a reliable system where the LLM can trigger specific document actions like "insert a table", "format this as math", "create a cover letter from this outline", etc.
Security & Stability	OpenOffice is not sandboxed; executing arbitrary code via extensions/macros can be dangerous. You‚Äôll need good guardrails.
Platform Support	OpenOffice has limited community support compared to LibreOffice, which might make development slower and debugging harder.
üîß What a MVP Could Look Like
Architecture:
Frontend (Plugin Panel):
A docked panel in OpenOffice (maybe using Java + UNO or Python + PyUNO) that displays chat history and lets user type prompts.
Backend:
A local microservice (Python/FastAPI?) that:
Sends prompts to the LLM.
Receives structured responses (e.g., "action": "insertText", "content": "Dear Sir or Madam...")
Uses pyuno to call OpenOffice APIs and perform the action.
LLM Prompting Layer:
System prompt defines the ‚Äútools‚Äù available (insert text, format math, apply style).
You ask model to respond in structured JSON or call a function like insert_text(text).
üß† Feasibility Verdict
Feasible: Yes ‚Äî it's absolutely possible with Python, OpenOffice UNO APIs, and any LLM (GPT-4, Claude, or open models like Mistral/LLaMA).
Effort: Moderate-to-high. Expect ~2-3 weeks for MVP if experienced with OpenOffice APIs, longer if not.
Recommendation: Strongly consider targeting LibreOffice instead ‚Äî it‚Äôs nearly the same API-wise, but with better support, documentation, and a more active ecosystem.

I'm thinking of making it Math-focused for now. So, a tool for converting a textual description to a Math object, a tool for converting a picture to a math object, a tool for converting LaTeX code into a Math object, and vice-versa for many of those. How plausible is this, and does it change greatly if we go with local models vs. API key access to remote models?
ChatGPT said:
That's an excellent scope ‚Äî focusing on math object generation in OpenOffice Math is plausible and significantly more focused, which increases your chances of success for a compelling MVP. Here's how this breaks down:
üß† What You're Proposing
A Cursor-style plugin for OpenOffice Math, with features like:
Feature	Description
1. Text ‚Üí Math	"The integral from 0 to infinity of e to the minus x squared" ‚Üí MathML or OpenOffice Math syntax
2. Image ‚Üí Math	Handwritten or typeset math image ‚Üí extracted formula inserted into Math editor
3. LaTeX ‚Üí Math	Convert LaTeX into OpenOffice Math syntax
4. Math ‚Üí LaTeX / Natural Language	Extract math objects from the document and convert them into LaTeX or plain English
‚úÖ Feasibility by Feature
Feature	Feasible?	How
Text ‚Üí Math	‚úÖ Easy	LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Mistral 7B) excel at this.
Image ‚Üí Math	‚ö†Ô∏è Medium	Needs OCR + Math understanding. Use tools like MathPix API, LaTeX-OCR, or Im2LaTeX.
LaTeX ‚Üí Math	‚úÖ Easy	Translate LaTeX to OpenOffice Math syntax (it's a different markup). Can use LLM or regex with known mapping.
Math ‚Üí LaTeX / Text	‚úÖ Easy to Medium	Use UNO API to extract math expressions, then convert using rule-based or LLM transformation.
OpenOffice Math has its own formula syntax (similar to LaTeX, but not identical), e.g.:
i
n
t
f
r
o
m
0
t
o
i
n
f
i
n
i
t
y
e
‚àí
x
2
d
x
intfrom0toinfinitye 
‚àíx 
2
 
 dx
So the plugin would need to translate between LaTeX and this syntax, and insert the results into the OpenOffice Math document.
üîÑ Local Model vs API Key (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
1. Text ‚Üí Math
Local: Very feasible with Mistral, OpenHermes, LLaMA 3, or Phi-3 if you fine-tune prompts or use few-shot examples.
Remote: GPT-4 is highly reliable and can output clean Math syntax first try.
2. Image ‚Üí Math
Local: Harder. You‚Äôd need to run LaTeX-OCR (TensorFlow, PyTorch model). Can be done but needs setup and GPU.
Remote: MathPix API is gold standard (but commercial). It outputs LaTeX from images with high fidelity.
3. LaTeX ‚Üí Math syntax
Local: Works great with smaller models using prompt tuning.
Remote: LLMs are excellent at this. GPT-4 or Claude can do it instantly.
4. Math ‚Üí LaTeX/Natural Language
Local: Need custom prompt examples or rule-based converter.
Remote: LLMs easily convert ‚ÄúOpenOffice math‚Äù syntax to LaTeX or natural language descriptions.
üîß Architecture Sketch
Here's how the system could be organized:
Plugin (Python/Java):
Provides a chat-like or toolbar interface in OpenOffice Math.
Uses UNO API to insert/extract math formulae.
LLM Service (Local or API):
Input: "Convert 'integral from 0 to 1 of x squared dx' to OpenOffice Math"
Output: int from 0 to 1 x^2 dx
Image-to-LaTeX:
Local (LaTeX-OCR) or Remote (MathPix).
Pass result to LLM or converter for final insertion.
Conversion Engine:
LaTeX ‚Üî OpenOffice Math syntax rules.
Optional LLM fallback for ambiguous conversions.
üß™ MVP Strategy
If you're going for an MVP in a few weeks:
Phase	Deliverable
Week 1	Chat interface that accepts a prompt and inserts a Math formula using LLM
Week 2	Add LaTeX ‚Üî OpenOffice Math conversion support
Week 3	Add image support (MathPix or LaTeX-OCR integration)
Week 4	Round-trip support (extract existing math and explain/convert)
üí° Final Thoughts
This is 100% plausible, especially if scoped to OpenOffice Math + LLM-powered chat interface + formula conversions.
A local-only setup is viable but will need more engineering and testing for math accuracy.
Remote LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic) are much more plug-and-play ‚Äî ideal for prototyping, less ideal for cost/privacy.
Would you like a sample prompt format or an API prototype to start connecting an LLM to OpenOffice Math?

I'm trying to get some practice with AWS, Docker, etc. One potential avenue that occurs to me is few-shot training a local model and hosting it on AWS is a safe and Docker-ized way to(with Kubernetes or whatever to handle spinning up and terminating the containers as needed). Is this a reasonable idea for how to implement this plug-in, or are there some crucial security/pricing/other concerns which render this a bad idea?
ChatGPT said:
You're thinking in exactly the right direction ‚Äî using Docker + Kubernetes on AWS to host a local model for your plugin is a realistic and modern architecture, especially if you're aiming for experience in cloud engineering and MLOps. But there are some key considerations around cost, security, performance, and scalability that you'll want to evaluate.
‚úÖ Why This is a Solid Idea
Real-world relevance:
Hosting a local model behind a secure endpoint (API) is exactly how AI-based tools are deployed in production.
Combines AI + DevOps + cloud cost awareness ‚Äî all valuable skills.
Modular design:
Your OpenOffice plugin stays lightweight, just sending structured requests to your LLM API.
You can update, scale, or swap models easily.
Safe experimentation:
You can test prompts, tools, and fine-tuning with version-controlled model containers.
Docker ensures reproducibility and isolates environments.
üö® Challenges to Consider
1. Security Concerns
Area	Mitigation
Public Endpoint	Use AWS API Gateway + IAM/Authorizer, or limit access to internal VPC.
Model Misuse	If the model can generate or interpret arbitrary code/text, limit access to only predefined tools and patterns.
LLM API risks	Don‚Äôt allow the LLM to control infrastructure unless heavily sandboxed.
If this is only for your plugin‚Äôs use, you can whitelist IPs or deploy to a private subnet with secure access.
2. Cost Considerations
Cost Component	Notes
EC2 for hosting model	Hosting even a small 7B model (e.g. Mistral, LLaMA 3) requires 8‚Äì16GB VRAM, so a GPU instance like g4dn.xlarge (~$0.50‚Äì$0.80/hr) or inf2 (for inference-optimized) is needed.
EBS + S3	Store model weights, images, LaTeX data, etc. Minimal cost unless you scale.
Kubernetes (EKS)	More complexity, higher baseline cost unless you're using EKS Fargate or running spot instances smartly.
üß† Pro tip: Use Docker Compose locally and AWS ECS Fargate or Lambda (if small model) to minimize Kubernetes overhead if you're solo dev.
3. Latency & Throughput
Self-hosted models often have higher latency than OpenAI APIs.
Use FastAPI + async inference queue (like TGI or vLLM) for better throughput.
Load test early to avoid surprises.
üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Stack for MVP
Component	Tool
Model server	llama-cpp, vLLM, or Text Generation Inference in Docker
Inference API	FastAPI w/ REST endpoint /generate_math
Prompt & Tool Routing	In-code function calling or JSON schema-based prompt
Cloud deployment	ECS (simpler) or EKS (more scalable)
CI/CD	GitHub Actions ‚Üí Docker Hub / ECR
Auth	API key validation on server or AWS IAM if VPC-bound
Plugin communication	HTTP/JSON RPC from OpenOffice Python/Java plugin
üîê Security Best Practices
Do not expose raw LLM prompts directly ‚Äî wrap with task-specific APIs (e.g. /describe_math, /convert_latex, etc.).
Add rate limiting.
Validate inputs from the plugin before passing to LLM (especially for LaTeX, which can include malicious code).
üß™ Bonus: Serverless Option?
For small models like Phi-3 or distilled variants, you might explore:
AWS Lambda + EFS model loading: slower cold starts but cheap for occasional use
Sagemaker Serverless (if you need autoscaling and ML-specific infra)
‚úÖ Verdict: Great Idea with Caveats
You're:
Practicing real-world DevOps/MLOps
Keeping the plugin thin and safe
Making it scalable for future teams
But:
Expect GPU costs unless you go very small or accept latency
Keep security and prompt scope tight
Kubernetes might be overkill for v1 unless you want to learn it specifically
Would you like a starter Dockerfile + FastAPI service that can serve prompts to a local Mistral or Phi model to integrate with the plugin?
