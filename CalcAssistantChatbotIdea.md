Alright, I have another idea for a Calc Cursor-esque chatbot which answers questions about how to do things (complicated formulas, groupings, queries, etc). Is this a reasonable idea? How does this change if we say we want to chatbot to also be able to edit the spreadsheet?

This would take the form of a plugin, the chatbot would be a Llama3 fewshot trained model being hosted on AWS.

Your idea for a Calc Cursor-esque chatbot that explains how to perform complex spreadsheet operations ‚Äî and possibly edits spreadsheets directly ‚Äî is absolutely a reasonable and valuable idea, especially in the context of enterprise modernization like the Legacy Modernization Project described in your file.
Let‚Äôs break it down in two phases:
‚úÖ Phase 1: A Chatbot That Explains Spreadsheet Logic
This version acts like a smart assistant helping users understand formulas, groupings, queries, pivot tables, etc.
Why it's reasonable:
Many users struggle with advanced spreadsheet functionality, especially business users.
Tools like Excel and Sheets have deep power, but poor discoverability.
This aligns with the goal of adding AI-assisted productivity on top of legacy systems (e.g., OpenOffice Calc or LibreOffice).
Key Technical Design:
Frontend: UI integration inside LibreOffice/OpenOffice or as a browser plugin for Google Sheets.
Backend: Llama3-powered API (hosted on AWS) with few-shot training examples for formula breakdowns, examples, etc.
UX: ‚ÄúAsk a question about this formula‚Äù or ‚ÄúExplain how to do X.‚Äù
üöÄ Phase 2: Add Spreadsheet Editing Capability
Now the chatbot not only explains, but writes or modifies formulas/cells, creates pivots, etc.
How this changes the game:
This turns it from ‚Äúassistant‚Äù to ‚Äúcopilot.‚Äù
Needs document state awareness (cell contents, ranges, data types).
You‚Äôd need an execution environment: e.g., an interface with Google Sheets API, or LibreOffice via UNO bindings.
More safety/permission concerns ‚Äî users need to trust edits.
Implementation notes:
Security: Ensure permission handling and visibility into what the AI is editing.
LLM grounding: Chatbot must be conditioned on spreadsheet context (i.e., rows/columns content) ‚Äî few-shot examples need structured cell data, not just freeform text.
UI affordances: Show previews of edits before committing.
üåü Strategic Fit With Enterprise Legacy Project
In the context of modernizing legacy office suites like OpenOffice/LibreOffice:
This chatbot could be one of your six new features (e.g., "AI Spreadsheet Assistant").
It adds genuine business value, especially to target users like:
Financial analysts
Operations managers
Sales coordinators using heavy spreadsheets
üí° Recommendations
If you're doing this as part of an Enterprise Week project:
Choose Path 2: Office Suite Platform Transformation.
Target a niche like "SMB financial teams who still use LibreOffice" or "Teachers managing grades in OpenOffice Calc".
Position your chatbot as a core AI feature to bring the suite into the modern age.
Want help scoping a prototype architecture (UI, model integration, spreadsheet API layer)?

My worry here specifically is that spreadsheets can often do some crazy thing, so giving the LLM tool access to edit spreadsheets would require a level of sandboxing/guard rails that I'm not sure I can feasibly provide.
ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right to be cautious ‚Äî giving an LLM write access to spreadsheets is a very different ballgame from just having it explain things.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why your concern is valid, what the core risks are, and a few options to mitigate without overengineering:
‚ö†Ô∏è Why It's Risky
Spreadsheets are often mission-critical.
One incorrect formula or bulk edit can cause real financial/logistical damage.
There's often no version control or rollback safety net, especially in older spreadsheet environments.
LLMs can hallucinate logic or apply formulas incorrectly to the wrong range.
Even small changes (like misaligning a $ in $A$1) can break entire models.
Edge cases are the norm, not the exception.
Nested conditionals, array formulas, pivot caches, lookup tables, etc.
These make safe automation very hard without full context.
Security implications if editing is done in cloud-linked sheets or shared files.
üõ°Ô∏è Guard Rails You Could Implement (But May Be Costly)
If you did want to support editing, here are guardrail strategies ‚Äî but each adds complexity:
Preview Mode Only: LLM suggests a change (e.g., "Replace formula in B2 with =SUMIF(...)"), and user must approve.
Dry Run Simulator: Clone the sheet in-memory and show diff view (before/after).
Cell Change Budget: Only allow LLM to make up to N changes at once.
Edit Constraints: Only allow changes to non-formula cells, or certain tabs/ranges.
Linter Validation: Validate formula syntax and safe references before applying.
Undo Stack: Auto-backup before every LLM action.
All of these are useful but can be heavy for an MVP.
‚úÖ Safer, Feasible Middle Ground: ‚ÄúHuman-in-the-Loop Edits‚Äù
Instead of full editing:
Let the LLM act as a formula generator and explainer, not a direct editor.
Present output as:
‚ÄúTo sum only the values in column C where column A equals ‚ÄòNorth‚Äô, enter:
=SUMIF(A:A, "North", C:C)‚Äù
Add buttons like ‚ÄúCopy to Clipboard‚Äù or ‚ÄúInsert to selected cell (with confirmation).‚Äù
This keeps agency with the user while greatly reducing risk.
Bonus: You Still Gain UX Lift
Even if the LLM never directly edits anything, just being able to say:
"Explain what this formula does: =INDEX(MATCH(‚Ä¶))"
or
"How do I extract unique names across sheets?"
...is already a huge value add for many users ‚Äî especially those using Calc/OpenOffice where modern assistive UX is almost nonexistent.
Final Verdict
Your instinct is correct: spreadsheets are complex enough that unrestricted LLM editing is risky. For a first version, keep the LLM in a read-only, suggestion-only role, and treat editing as a future stretch goal once you have:
Solid usage data
Known input patterns
A framework for safe changes
Would you like help sketching a plugin UI/UX where the LLM suggests formula edits but lets the user apply them manually? Or a prompt design for the model to generate spreadsheet-safe outputs?
You said:
Human-in-the-loop is an interesting idea. You bring up another interesting point - OpenOffice is not going to have a version control the way Cursor does, and we certainly have no ability to rely on Git. How does version control work for OpenOffice? Let's say specifically Calc.
ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up ‚Äî version control in OpenOffice Calc (and LibreOffice, similarly) is quite limited and nowhere near what you'd get in Cursor or Git-backed environments.
Let‚Äôs break down:
üßæ What Version Control Exists in OpenOffice Calc?
1. Manual Versioning (Built-In Feature)
OpenOffice does have a basic "Versions" feature:
Accessible via File ‚Üí Versions‚Ä¶
You can manually save a new version of the document at a given point.
You can add comments (e.g., ‚Äúbefore AI formula change‚Äù).
You can view and open old versions, but:
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot diff versions.
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot merge.
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot automatically restore parts ‚Äî it's all-or-nothing.
2. Save As Copies
A more common pattern is ad-hoc:
File ‚Üí Save As to my-spreadsheet-v2.ods, v3.ods, etc.
This is what most spreadsheet users do manually ‚Äî not robust, but practical.
3. No Git Integration
OpenOffice uses the ODS file format (a zipped XML container), so:
Git can technically track changes to .ods files (especially if unzipped).
But this is not human-meaningful diffs, and merge conflicts are almost impossible to resolve manually.
üõ°Ô∏è Why This Matters for Your Chatbot/Plugin
If you‚Äôre allowing the chatbot to suggest or preview potentially destructive edits, you have no fallback unless you:
Auto-create version snapshots, or
Prompt the user to save a version before applying AI-generated edits.
‚úÖ Practical Options to Simulate Versioning
Here‚Äôs what you could do in your plugin or chatbot workflow:
üîπ Option 1: Auto Backup Before Edit
Before applying any AI-driven change:
Save a duplicate: filename_backup_TIMESTAMP.ods
Store it either locally or in a temp folder with a rollback command.
üîπ Option 2: Export as Diffable Plaintext
Export the relevant sheet or range to .csv or .tsv.
Keep a history of those exports for audit/logging.
Useful for debugging or rollback but won‚Äôt preserve formulas.
üîπ Option 3: Use Comments as "Change Proposals"
Instead of editing a cell, the bot inserts a comment like:
üí° Suggest replacing =A1+B1 with =SUM(A1:B1)
This avoids irreversible edits and makes changes reviewable.
üîπ Option 4: "AI Changes History" Sidebar
Your plugin maintains a sidecar file (.json) that records:
Timestamp
What was changed
Suggested by AI vs accepted by user
Acts as a lightweight version history, even if OpenOffice itself doesn‚Äôt track it.
üí° Summary: Version Control in Calc is Weak, So You Must Bring Your Own Safety
Feature	Built-In	Recommendation
Git-like diffs	‚ùå	Simulate with CSV/text
Auto-versioning	‚ùå	Implement via backup copies
Change tracking	üü° Manual	Use comments or plugin history
Restore prior state	‚úÖ (Manual)	Prompt user to save version before edit
Collaborative history	‚ùå	Out of scope for OpenOffice
If you‚Äôd like, I can help you sketch out a minimal plugin structure that includes:
LLM-powered formula suggestions
Pre-edit version snapshot
User confirmation interface
Want that?
You said:
Can the plug in do a save version before editing automatically?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, a plugin for OpenOffice Calc can automatically save a version (or simulate one) before performing any edits ‚Äî but with some caveats.
Here's what you need to know:
‚úÖ Yes, You Can Automate Version Backups in a Plugin
OpenOffice supports scripting and extensions via:
UNO API (Universal Network Objects) ‚Äî main way to interact with documents
You can write plugins in Python, Java, C++, or Basic
Using these, your plugin can:
üîπ 1. Create a Snapshot (Backup File)
You can programmatically:
Get the current document path and name
Create a copy with a timestamp:
import datetime
timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
backup_path = f"{original_path}_backup_{timestamp}.ods"
doc.storeToURL(backup_path, ())
Store this either in the same folder or a backup directory
This gives you a restorable state, just like ‚ÄúSave As.‚Äù
üîπ 2. Trigger Built-In Version Save
OpenOffice has a native Versions feature (as seen in File ‚Üí Versions‚Ä¶), and you can access it through the UNO API. But:
It‚Äôs not well-documented for programmatic access
It‚Äôs less reliable than simply creating backup files
It's stored inside the .ods file, so rolling back is all-or-nothing
So in practice, the external backup is better and safer.
‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
User must have saved the file once ‚Äî new untitled files (not saved yet) don‚Äôt have a file path, so you‚Äôll need to:
Prompt them to save first
Or default to a temp location
Permissions ‚Äî OpenOffice extensions may need permission to write files, especially on locked-down enterprise systems.
Performance ‚Äî Making backups of large .ods files could introduce a delay; consider showing a ‚ÄúSaving backup‚Ä¶‚Äù status.
‚úÖ Suggested Workflow in Plugin
User asks the AI for help
‚ûú ‚ÄúHow do I group sales by region?‚Äù
AI generates a formula or action
‚ûú Suggests =SUMIF(...) in cell D2
Plugin triggers saveBackup() function
‚ûú Stores sales_backup_20250721_1440.ods
Plugin presents a preview
‚ûú Shows what the formula will change
User clicks ‚ÄúApply‚Äù
‚ûú Plugin inserts formula, change is tracked
üß™ TL;DR
‚úÖ Yes: A Calc plugin can create a versioned backup before edits.
üü° Prefer creating timestamped copies over using OpenOffice's internal "Versions" feature.
‚ö†Ô∏è Handle edge cases like unsaved documents or large file sizes.
Would you like a sample saveBackup() function using Python+UNO you could use in your plugin?
