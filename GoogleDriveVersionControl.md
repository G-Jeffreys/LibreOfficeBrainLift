If you have multiple people who have access to the same Google Drive document and they both edit the document (no in-browser, using something on their computer), how does version control work there?

For context, I am making a plugin for OpenOffice which allows you to open Google Drive documents and edit them in OpenOffice and save them back to the cloud, so I am concerned by how I should/how much I should handle version control.
ChatGPT said:
When multiple users access and edit a Google Drive document without using the browser (i.e., through a third-party app like your OpenOffice plugin), version control becomes complex because Google Docs is inherently built for real-time, in-browser, collaborative editing with automatic conflict resolution.
Since you‚Äôre building a plugin for OpenOffice that will download/edit/upload Google Drive documents outside that real-time ecosystem, here‚Äôs how Google Drive handles this ‚Äî and what you need to do:
üß† How Google Drive Handles Version Control (Non-browser clients):
Versioning is file-based.
Google Drive keeps every uploaded version of a file. When a new file is uploaded with the same name/path, it becomes a new version of that file.
You can view/download previous versions, but Drive doesn't automatically merge content from concurrent edits made offline.
No conflict resolution is automatic outside Docs UI.
If two users edit a file separately (e.g., in OpenOffice) and both upload their edits:
The last one to upload overwrites the previous.
Google Drive does not merge or warn ‚Äî only version history will show both versions, in sequence.
üîß What Your Plugin Should Do:
To safely integrate OpenOffice with Google Drive, here are recommendations for handling version control:
‚úÖ 1. Fetch and store a file revision ID upon download
Google Drive API provides a revisionId for every file version.
When downloading a file, store the current revisionId.
‚úÖ 2. Compare revisionId before upload
Before uploading edits:
Fetch the latest revisionId from Drive.
If it matches the one stored ‚Üí safe to upload.
If it does not match ‚Üí another user has modified the file in the meantime.
‚ö†Ô∏è 3. If revision mismatch, prompt the user
When the IDs don‚Äôt match:
Alert the user: ‚ÄúThis document has been updated since you last downloaded it.‚Äù
Offer choices:
Overwrite the remote version.
Save as a new version/copy.
Download the new version and re-apply changes manually.
üí° 4. Auto-upload as a new version (safe default)
To avoid overwrites without confirmation, default behavior could be:
Save user edits as a new file (e.g., ‚ÄúFilename (YourName‚Äôs edits).odt‚Äù).
Let the user merge manually or share via Drive.
üîí Optional Enhancements
Implement file locking: When a user starts editing, create a temporary marker file in Drive or use Drive comments/metadata to signal a "lock".
Use Google Workspace File Stream API or Workspaces for better syncing (but these are enterprise features).
üß≠ Summary: What You Must Handle
Concern	Should Plugin Handle?	Notes
File version conflicts	‚úÖ Yes	Use revisionId
Real-time merging	‚ùå No	Too complex outside browser
Auto-versioning	‚úÖ Yes	Upload with keepRevisionForever if needed
User alerts on conflict	‚úÖ Yes	Warn users before overwriting
Offline edits	‚úÖ Yes	But treat with care if stale
Let me know if you'd like example code using the Google Drive API to handle revisionId comparison or upload workflows.
